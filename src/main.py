"""Self-watering garden proof of concept

Two relays are used:
    - 1 for a classic pump: Pin 2,
    - 1 for water nebulizers for orchids: Pin 12

Humidity sensor: ADC0

The smallest interval between actions is 1 hour. During this time the ESP is put
into deep sleep.

Flash command:
    $ ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 put main.py
Bytecode compilation for ESP8266:
    $ mpy-cross -march=xtensa main.py

    PS: Do not forget to add the following lines to boot.py:
    ```import main
    main.main()```
